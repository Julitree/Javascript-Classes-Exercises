Classes were added in last version of JavaScript (called ECMAScript 6 or just ES6). It's something similar to how classes 
work in other languages (Java, Ruby, etc). This is a very important concept in programming, so sooner or later you'll want 
to learn about it. 
(And I highly recommend you to do it before the Java modules).
